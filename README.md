## Known Bugs
'creat' - displays multiple copies when creating a file in a created directory.  
'rm' and 'mkdir' - using rm on longfiles and then using mkdir and then using cd into the new dirctory   
and running ls, it will show corrupted text for some reson. Unsure of why this happens.  
'read' - Reading files somtimes leaves out a few characters of text when eading file longer than one cluster.  
May be an issue with how many bytes are being read in with fcget().  
'size' - when chainging the text with write() on a file, the size command sometimes hows the previous size of
the file.   


## List of Files in the Repository
filesys.c - Contains all the fuctions to manipulate and read data of different files in the fat32.img. Also contains 
the menu to ru the functions required by the project.  
README.md - documentation of the project that we are currently reading. Contains bugs, work division, list of files,
and how to compile the project.  
fat32.img - fat image that contains the files we are manipulating in the project.   
Makefile - makefile to to compile the project creating the executable, as well as clean to clean out the exectuable.  

## How to Compile Using Makefile
typing 'make' creates the 'filesys' executable that can be run by typing './filesys fat32.img. This begins the   
project where you can run the commands reuired for the project.
